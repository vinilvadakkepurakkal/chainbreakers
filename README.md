SAMHAR COVID-19 Hackathon

We are developing an interactive solution to assist health professional to get speedy, accurate and latest insights from huge amount of COVID-19 literatures.

Given the large number of literature and the rapid spread of COVID-19, it is difficult for health professionals to keep up with new information on the virus. There are more than 44000 research articles already published and its growing. This is a very big challenge for a health care professional to get the speedy and accurate information from all the literature available in the world.  

In addition, there is a need for getting the insight quickly, which can accelerate the COVID-19 vaccination research. Our solution to provide speedy, accurate & latest information via a context aware Chat-bot which will do the data mining from given articles based on Abstract, Author, Publication, Vital keywords etc. The heart of the system will be a clustering algorithm, which would do the cluster of 44000 articles based on the key words and other user inputs. User interaction will be through context aware Deep NLP chat-bot, which would provide the generic information about corona/COVID-19 information (preventive measures, helpline, medical facilities etc) and article search for relevant topics. Also chat-bot can auto summarize the articles based on user demand, this will enhance the experience of health professional to get the summary of the literature quickly.
